## memory

## Sequential logic and Combinational logic

* Dealing with time:

![]()

* Combinatorial Logic:
Combinatorial: out[t] = function(int[t])

Sequential: out[t] = function(int[t])



## Flip Flops

### dff

![dff]()

* General way to build memory and counter

### bit chip 

![]()

### difference between dff and bit chip

## Memory Units


difference between memory and register

## read and write a register

## Counters

reset: fetch the first instruction
next: fetch the next instruction
goto: fetch instruction n


### Counter abstraction
